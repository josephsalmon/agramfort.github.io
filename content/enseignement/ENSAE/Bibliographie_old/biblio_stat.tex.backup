%\section{Introduction}





Voici une brève bibliographie de livres et d'autres supports avancer en statistiques. Attention, la plupart des références sont en  anglais.

\section{Statistique non-paramétrique}
\begin{btUnit}
\begin{btSect}[alpha2]{refs}

Il est bon de commencer par \cite{Silverman86}, très bien illustré et facile à lire. Dans un second temps la théorie est impeccable dans \cite{Tsybakov04}.
