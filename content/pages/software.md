- [BenchOpt](https://benchopt.github.io/): package to simplify, make more transparent and more reproducible comparisons between optimization algorithms

- [Celer](https://mathurinm.github.io/celer/): a fast Lasso solver, code of the associated ICML2018 paper "Dual Extrapolation for Faster Lasso Solvers" ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07481), [slides](http://localhost/talks/UBC.pdf))
- [sparse-ho](https://github.com/QB3/sparse-ho): a fast hyper-parameter package to select the best Lasso parameter efficiently,
code of the associated ICML2020 paper "Implicit differentiation of Lasso-type models for hyperparameter optimization" ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08943.pdf))
- [matlab toolboxes](code/index_codes.php) for statistics and image processing (this is legacy)
